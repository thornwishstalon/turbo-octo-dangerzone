(*) piped parser to make use of multi-threading and creating an inverted index in a single pass.
	Stream reading line from a file
	-> line is passed to:  
	-> tokenizer :
	-> remove special characters: 
	-> do case folding:
	-> do stop word removal:
	-> do stemming:
	->* optional bigram buffer:
	-> indexer:

a pipe stage is implemented as a thread, which is managed by a thread pool in order to draw advantages from multi-CPU computers.

(*)Used datastructures
we used java's TreeMap to store postings, which is a Red-black Tree, which is a balanced binary tree after all and allows us to search 
pretty fast for existing terms.

(*)in order to avoid in-memory bottleneck the currently active index is saved and merged with the rest of the blocks later 
(following SPMI-indexing from the book). JSON ?

Reusable Processing pipeline... etc
